        "\n",
        "ANSWER 1      A RESTful API (Representational State Transfer API) is a web-based interface that allows different software applications to communicate with each other over the internet. It follows a set of architectural principles and guidelines defined by REST.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here are the key features of a RESTful API:\n",
        "- **Stateless**: Each request from the client contains all the necessary information, so the server doesn't store any client state between requests.\n",
        "- **Resources**: Everything the API interacts with is treated as a resource (like users, orders, or products) and is identified by unique URLs.\n",
        "- **HTTP Methods**: RESTful APIs use standard HTTP methods, such as:\n",
        "  - `GET` to retrieve data.\n",
        "  - `POST` to create new resources.\n",
        "  - `PUT` or `PATCH` to update resources.\n",
        "  - `DELETE` to remove resources.\n",
        "- **JSON or XML**: Data is commonly exchanged in lightweight formats like JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) or XML.\n",
        "- **Stateless Operations**: The interaction between client and server is stateless, meaning each request is independent.\n",

        "ANSWER 2   An **API specification** is a document or description that defines how an API should behave and how developers can interact with it. It serves as a blueprint for building and consuming APIs, ensuring everyone involved—whether they're building the API or integrating with it—has a clear understanding of its functionality and requirements.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here’s what an API specification typically includes:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Endpoints**: The URLs where the API's resources can be accessed, like `/users` or `/orders/{id}`.\n",
        "2. **Methods**: The HTTP methods (e.g., `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`) supported by each endpoint.\n",
        "3. **Request Structure**:\n",
        "   - Path parameters: Values embedded in the URL, like `/{id}`.\n",
        "   - Query parameters: Additional information sent in the URL, like `?sort=asc`.\n",
        "   - Headers: Metadata sent with the request, like authentication tokens.\n",
        "   - Body: Data sent in the request for methods like `POST` or `PUT`, often in JSON format.\n",
        "4. **Response Structure**: Details about the data the API returns, including status codes (`200 OK`, `404 Not Found`, etc.), headers, and body content.\n",
        "5. **Authentication**: The security mechanism, such as API keys or OAuth tokens, required to access the API.\n",
        "6. **Error Handling**: Explanation of potential errors (e.g., invalid input) and how they're conveyed (e.g., specific error codes or messages).\n",
        "7. **Rate Limits**: Restrictions on the number of requests allowed in a given timeframe.\n",

        "ANSWER 3.  Flask is a lightweight and flexible web framework written in Python. It’s designed to help developers build web applications and APIs quickly and with minimal overhead. Flask is classified as a \"micro-framework,\" meaning it provides the core tools needed for web development but doesn't impose many constraints or include unnecessary features.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why Flask is Popular for Building APIs:\n",
        "1. **Lightweight and Simple**: Flask is minimalist by design, which means developers have full control over the components and can choose the libraries or tools they want to use. This makes it highly customizable.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Ease of Use**: Flask's syntax is straightforward, making it beginner-friendly and easy to learn, especially for those familiar with Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Flexibility**: Since Flask doesn’t enforce a specific project structure or way of doing things, developers have the freedom to design their APIs the way they want.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Built-in Development Server**: Flask includes features like a built-in development server and a debugger, which streamline the development process.\n",

        "5. **RESTful API Support**: Flask is well-suited for creating RESTful APIs thanks to its simplicity and the ability to easily define routes, handle HTTP methods, and return JSON responses.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Extension Ecosystem**: Though minimalistic, Flask has a wide range of community-built extensions for functionalities like database integration, authentication, or API documentation.\n",

        "Q 4.  What is routing in Flask?\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "ANSWER 4.   Routing in Flask refers to the process of mapping URLs (or routes) to specific functions that handle requests for those URLs. It is how Flask determines what code to execute when a user accesses a particular path in a web application or API.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Concepts of Routing in Flask:\n",
        "1. **Defining Routes**: You define routes using the `@app.route()` decorator in Flask. Each route corresponds to a specific URL and is linked to a Python function.\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   from flask import Flask\n",
        "\n",
        "   app = Flask(__name__)\n",
        "\n",
        "   @app.route('/')\n",
        "   def home():\n",
        "       return 'Welcome to the homepage!'\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "   In this example, accessing the root URL (`'/'`) will trigger the `home()` function, returning \"Welcome to the homepage!\".\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Dynamic Routes**: Flask allows you to define dynamic routes by including variable sections in the URL. For example:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   @app.route('/user/<username>')\n",
        "   def show_user(username):\n",
        "       return f'Hello, {username}!'\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "   Here, `<username>` acts as a placeholder that Flask will replace with the actual value passed in the URL.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **HTTP Methods**: By default, routes respond to GET requests. You can specify other HTTP methods, like POST, PUT, DELETE, etc., using the `methods` argument.\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   @app.route('/submit', methods=['POST'])\n",
        "   def submit():\n",
        "       return 'Form submitted!'\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **URL Building**: Flask provides a `url_for()` function that helps generate URLs dynamically based on route names, making it easier to manage links in your application.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why Routing Matters:\n",
        "- **Modularity**: Routes organize your application into functional components.\n",
        "- **Flexibility**: Dynamic routes make it possible to serve variable content.\n",
        "- **Efficiency**: Specifying HTTP methods ensures routes handle only the intended types of requests.\n",

        "1. **Temporary Data Storage**:\n",
        "   - The `session` object stores data temporarily, but unlike cookies, it keeps the data on the server.\n",
        "   - A unique session ID is sent to the client as a cookie to identify their session.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **User-Specific Data**:\n",
        "   - Each user's session is isolated, enabling the storage of specific information like login details, preferences, or progress.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Secure Data Handling**:\n",
        "   - Sessions in Flask are signed using a secret key (`app.secret_key`), preventing unauthorized access or tampering.\n",
        "   - However, they are not encrypted, so avoid storing sensitive information.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Persistent Across Requests**:\n",
        "   - Data stored in the `session` remains available throughout a user's interaction with the app, as long as the session cookie is valid.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Simple API**:\n",
        "   - The `session` object acts like a dictionary, making it easy to add, retrieve, or remove data:\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     from flask import Flask, session\n",
        "\n",
        "     app = Flask(__name__)\n",
        "     app.secret_key = 'mysecretkey'  # Required for sessions\n",
        "\n",
        "     @app.route('/set')\n",
        "     def set_session():\n",
        "         session['username'] = 'Bhoomi'\n",
        "         return 'Session data set!'\n",
        "\n",
        "     @app.route('/get')\n",
        "     def get_session():\n",
        "         username = session.get('username', 'Guest')\n",
        "         return f'Hello, {username}!'\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Session Lifetime**:\n",
        "   - By default, Flask sessions expire when the browser is closed.\n",
        "   - You can configure session expiration or customization using Flask extensions, like `Flask-Session`.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Common Uses of `session`:\n",
        "- **Authentication**: To track logged-in users.\n",
        "- **Personalization**: Storing user preferences or settings.\n",
        "- **Shopping Carts**: Keeping track of items added by users.\n",
        "- **Multi-step Forms**: Temporarily storing user input across multiple pages.\n"
